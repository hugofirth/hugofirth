I’m Hugo: a software engineer who enjoys working on distributed systems, databases and graph-data problems.

I’ve spent the last 6 years working on the distributed version of [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j). Before that I worked as a Research Engineer and did a PhD at Newcastle University in the UK.


### 🔭 Worked on
In addition to my pinned repos, here are a few interesting things I've worked on "behind closed doors": 

- Several large extensions to Neo4j's [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) implementation including mulit-raft, leadership transfer and raft observers/non-voters.
- An eventually consistent discovery service for Neo4j clusters built upon CRDTs and gossip.
- [Techniques for sharding graphs](https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/10443/4416/1/Firth%20H%202018.pdf), optimising data distribution for a provided query workload to be executed over the graph.
