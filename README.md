I’m Hugo: a software engineer who enjoys working on distributed systems, databases and graph-data problems.

I’ve spent the last 5 years working on the distributed version of Neo4j. Before that I did a PhD and worked as a Research Engineer at Newcastle University.

### 🖊️ Some things I've written:

… and made notes (of varying quality).

### ⚙️ Some things I’ve implemented:
… largely behind closed doors. I’ve pinned repos where p**oss**ible.

- Several large extensions to a [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) implementation widely used in production including mulit-raft, leadership transfer and raft observers/non-voters.
- An eventually consistent cluster discovery service built upon CRDTs and gossip.
- [Techniques for sharding graphs](https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/10443/4416/1/Firth%20H%202018.pdf), optimising data distribution for a provided query workload to be executed over the graph.
